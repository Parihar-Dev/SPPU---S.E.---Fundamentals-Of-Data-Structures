'''
Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N
students in the class. Write functions to compute following: 
a) The average score of class 
b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
c) Count of students who were absent for the test 
d) Display mark with highest frequency
